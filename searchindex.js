You reached the AbSolute book. AbSolute is a constraint solver written in OCaml for research purposes, but we hope that it can be used outside of research as well! The main originality of this solver is to be based on abstract interpretation , which is a field studying static analysis of programs. We and others have discovered similitudes between constraint programming and abstract interpretation at the theoretical level, and this solver is a practical experimentation of these findings. In this book, you will learn how to install AbSolute and how to solve your own constraint problems . We also include a guide to kobe which is a benchmarking tool with support for AbSolute and other solvers. For adventurous users, we provide a guide for contributing to Absolute, as well as some notes about the research relevant to this project. This project is available on github .","title":"Introduction","id":"README.html#introduction"},"changelog.html#changelog":{"breadcrumbs":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","body":"We describe the main changes operated in each version of AbSolute. This is especially useful when analyzing the results in kobe-database . Version 0.10.0: Add a function has_changed in Abstract_domain to detect fixed point of the closure operator more precisely. Fix bugs in CascadeProduct . Version 0.9.2: Fix a bugs in replace_uid and instantiate_vars where constraints were wrongly rewritten. Version 0.9.1: Rewrite the solve function in CPS to avoid possible stack overflow. Version 0.9.0: Add the domain product Delayed_product which transfers a constraint to a more specialized domain when instantiated enough. Propagator_completion now automatically exchanges equalities over its sub-domains. Add a minimalist search strategy language. Version 0.8.0: Add an embed function which is the inverse of project in abstract domain, it increases the efficiency of the HC4 algorithm. Fix the min/max filtering in interval. New converter between bounds to avoid always going through rational when converting a bound. Version 0.7.0: Add the propagator completion domain transformer, which equips any projection-based abstract domain with propagators. The box domain does not contain anymore its constraints. Fix a bug when selecting the new bounds in the branch-and-bound algorithm. Version 0.6.0: New architecture of products based on abstract domain sharing. Typing of the logic formula according to the type of an abstract domain. Note: this version was bugged due to a problem in the BAB algorithm (fixed in 0.7.0).","id":"changelog.html#changelog"},"benchmarking-tutorial.html#running-the-new-model":{"title":"Running the new model","id":"benchmarking-tutorial.html#running-the-new-model","body":"That should be it!

A complete description is available on Wikipedia . A simple model for this problem is constituted of n variables x1,...,xN , one for each queen. Since, it is only possible to have one queen per line on the chess board, we can already decide that x1 is on the first line, x2 on the second, etc. The following function creates a list of string variables: (** [make_vars n] creates `n` variables named `x1`,...,`xn`. *)\nlet rec make_vars = function | 0 -> [] | n -> (\"x\" ^ (string_of_int n))::(make_vars (n-1)) The value of the variable xi will be the column of xi on the chess board. Therefore, a queen variable can take a value between 1 and n . These corresponds to constraints of the form x1 >= 0 /\\ x1 <= n , which translates in OCaml as: (** [var_in_dom l u x] ensures that `x >= l` and `x <= u`. *)\nlet var_in_dom l u x = [Cmp(Var x, GEQ, Cst(Bound_rat.of_int l, Int)); Cmp(Var x, LEQ, Cst(Bound_rat.of_int u, Int))] (** [vars_in_dom l u vars] ensures that all variables in `vars` are in the interval [l..u]. *)\nlet rec vars_in_dom l u = function | [] -> [] | x::vars -> (var_in_dom l u x)@(vars_in_dom l u vars) Finally, we need to ensure that two queens cannot attack each other. For instance, to check that xi and xj do not attack each other, we need to fulfill the following constraints ( i < j ): xi != xj : xi and xj are not on the same column. qi + i != qj + j : xi and xj are not on a same ascending diagonal. qi - i != qj - j : xi and xj are not on a same descending diagonal. This translates into OCaml as follows: let noattack vars i j = let qi, qj = List.nth vars i, List.nth vars j in let ci = Cst(Bound_rat.of_int i, Int) in let cj = Cst(Bound_rat.of_int j, Int) in [Cmp(Var qi, NEQ, Var qj); Cmp(Binary(Var qi, ADD, ci), NEQ, Binary(Var qj, ADD, cj)); Cmp(Binary(Var qi, SUB, ci), NEQ, Binary(Var qj, SUB, cj))] let rec noattack_i vars i j = if j >= List.length vars then [] else (noattack vars i j)@(noattack_i vars i (j+1)) let noattack_all vars = let rec aux i = if i >= List.length vars then [] else (noattack_i vars i (i+1))@(aux (i+1)) in aux 0 By assembling all these constraints, we can design the full formula for the n-queens problem: let make_nqueens n = let vars = List.rev (make_vars n) in let domains = List.rev (vars_in_dom 1 n vars) in let constraints = List.rev (noattack_all vars) in let rec make_formula = function | [] -> QFFormula (conjunction (domains@constraints)) | x::vars -> Exists(x, Concrete Int, make_formula vars) in make_formula vars It generates a conjunctive formula with variables existentially quantified, for instance: Ǝx1.Ǝx2...Ǝxn.x1 >= 1 /\\ ... /\\ x7 - 6 <> x8 - 7 ."},"learn-absolute.html#type-the-formula-in-the-abstract-domain":{"breadcrumbs":"Type the formula in the abstract domain","body":"We now have the formula on one side, and the abstract domain on the other side.

About the coding guidelines, you should try to code in the same way than the rest of the project, please observe how we code and do the same. One very important rule is that you indent using 2 spaces and not tabulations , and create .ml and its documented .mli companion for every new file.
