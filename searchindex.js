These files are stored in the output_dir directory. For conveniency, kobegen outputs a list of the benchmarking commands to execute next, for example: ./exec.sh database/rcpsp/patterson.rcp/absolute-v0.4.0/Octagon-MSLF_simple.json database/rcpsp/patterson.rcp/absolute-v0.4.0/Octagon-MSLF_simple.csv ./exec.sh is a user-defined script specified in the field bench_exec of the configuration file, and it takes two arguments: .../Octagon-MSLF_simple.json which is the flatten configuration file. .../Octagon-MSLF_simple.csv which is the name of the result (this file is not yet created since the benches have not yet been performed). These two files are together in the database so we know exactly on what configuration a benchmark data set has been solved. kobegen does not execute exec.sh , it just outputs the commands to execute. It is particularly useful for launching benchmarks in parallel on a server, exec.sh can be used to launch a job.
